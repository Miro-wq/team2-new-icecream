        Ice is a place where you will become not only a <br>
        little happier, but also healthier. Health is the <br>
        main value for us, and we follow it when creating <br>
        our handmade desserts.
      </p>
      <p>
         We use traditional recipes and 100% natural <br>
         ingredients. Our products are so natural that they can <br>
         be given to children from the age of three years. Sweets <br>
         lovers can expect 55 types of ice cream, 15 types of <br>
         coffee and 23 milkshakes.
